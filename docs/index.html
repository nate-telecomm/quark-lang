    <p><b>Quark</b> is a general purpose language that is aimed for... not-so general purposes. The architecture and design is inspired by Java.<br></p>

    <p>It has<br></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Extreme portability</li>
      <li>WORA with bytecode</li>
      <li>Compact packages known as Gluons (like <code>.jar</code>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>What do you mean "not-so general purpose"??</h1>
    <p>Well, sure, you could go and rewrite your webserver, your middleware, your whatever in Quark, but it isn't recommended. Quark is mainly aimed at distribution of small packages (Gluons) that are supposed to run on clusters or IoT devices.<br></p>
